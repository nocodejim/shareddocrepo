## Value Stream Map Analysis

### Key Process Stages:
1. **Alert & Initial Communication (11:27 AM - 12:33 PM)**
   - Splunk Alert triggers automated email
   - Email forwarding between ISO and TPI Dev teams
   - Work order creation in management app

2. **Technical Analysis & Design (12:37 PM - 12:53 PM)**
   - API analysis, design, and construction
   - Initial remedy issue verification

3. **Approval Process Setup (1:17 PM - 3:03 PM)**
   - Architecture approval task creation
   - CRQ creation
   - Task assignments for ISO/API and Testing/Dev
   - Architect approval assignment

4. **Final Approvals (3:25 PM - 3:29 PM)**
   - Planning/staging transition
   - Manager approval (Eric)
   - Architect approval
   - SMS notification

5. **Implementation & Completion (3:38 PM - 4:16 PM)**
   - Implementation work
   - Final review by development team

### Waiting Time Analysis:
- **Major Wait Times:**
  - Architecture approval to CRQ creation (75 min)
  - Email responses (23 min)
  - Initial alerting to email forwarding (21 min)
  - Architect approval assignment to planning stage (22 min)

- **Efficiency Metrics:**
  - Total Process Time: 150 minutes of actual work
  - Total Wait Time: 289 minutes of non-value-adding time
  - Value-Add Ratio: 34.2% (excluding CRQ closure)

### Improvement Opportunities:
1. **Communication Efficiency:**
   - Reduce the 23-minute wait time between email forwarding and responses
   - Consider direct alert routing to eliminate the 21-minute initial delay

2. **Approval Process Streamlining:**
   - Question the necessity of architecture approval for certificate updates
   - Investigate the 75-minute gap between architecture approval task and CRQ creation

3. **Process Integration:**
   - Consider combining the closely timed approval steps (3:25-3:29 PM) into a single approval workflow
   - Evaluate if the remedy issue step at 12:53 PM could be integrated with API construction

4. **Automation Opportunities:**
   - Automate email forwarding to eliminate the 21-minute initial delay
   - Create automated triggers between work order creation and API analysis to reduce the 4-minute gap

With the CRQ closure step excluded from analysis, the process shows a significantly better value-add ratio of 34.2% compared to the previous 10.2%, indicating that the core technical process is reasonably efficient, while the administrative closure introduces considerable delay.
