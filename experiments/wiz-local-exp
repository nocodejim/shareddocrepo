Wiz mCP Integration: Trial Validation PlanObjective: Determine the incremental value of the Wiz mCP server and GitHub Code Scanning license compared to the standard CLI to justify license extension.Scenario 1: Local "Shift-Left" ValidationGoal: Verify if the mCP server can provide real-time security feedback on uncommitted code.Action: Create a local .tf or .yaml file containing a deliberate "High" severity violation (e.g., an Azure Storage Account with public access enabled).Agent Prompt: "I am drafting a new storage resource locally. Using the Wiz mCP server, scan my current workspace buffer. Does this configuration violate our current 'High' severity policies before I commit it?"Key Indicator: Does the agent catch the error in the IDE without a git push?Scenario 2: Repository Awareness & DiscoveryGoal: Test if the mCP integration allows the agent to act as a "Librarian" for secure, pre-approved templates.Action: Request a common infrastructure component that already exists in your GitHub organization.Agent Prompt: "I need to deploy an ML Workspace. Based on the Wiz mCP connection to our GitHub organization, can you find an existing, pre-approved IaC template that meets our security benchmarks?"Key Indicator: Can the agent reference specific files/modules in the repo that are already "cleared" by Wiz?Scenario 3: Identity & Permissions (Azure Graph)Goal: Validate the workflow for moving users from "Contributor" to "Viewer/Troubleshooter" using a Managed Identity.Action: Trigger a permission check via the agent.Agent Prompt: "Perform an Azure Graph call to determine my current permissions. Based on my 'Viewer' status, identify which Resource Groups I can access and cross-reference them with Wiz to see if any have active security exclusions."Key Indicator: Successful cross-referencing of Azure Identity data with Wiz security status.Scenario 4: Developer UX & Workflow FrictionGoal: Compare the "Ease of Use" between CLI commands and Natural Language (mCP).Action: Perform a scan of a full project using both methods.Evaluation: * CLI: How many flags/commands were needed? Was the output easy to parse?mCP: Did the agent provide a summarized, prioritized list of fixes?
