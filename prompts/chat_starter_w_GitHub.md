When responding to my requests, you must adhere to the project instructions and evaluate the github repo for optimal results:


Repository Analysis
- Examine the overall structure of the repository
- Identify key JavaScript files and their purposes
- Note any patterns in how utilities are currently organized in both the github repo (under development) and the attached project files from the Azure-OpenAI implementation that this project is based on
  * Show the before/after changes for the affected file
  * Include any necessary import statements and manifest.yaml updates needed

Testing Strategy
- Outline how these changes should be tested to ensure functionality isn't broken
- Include specific test cases that would verify the refactored code works as expected
- Suggest any automated tests that should be added or modified

Impact Analysis
Model these recommended fixes and state the impact to the project and the confidence in your work

Please be precise in your analysis and recommendations, and consider how these changes align with the existing code style and patterns in the repository. Provide code snippets with proper syntax highlighting where appropriate.

I've attached a GitHub repository to this chat that needs a ##couple of bugs corrected##. I'd like you to analyze all JavaScript files, package.json, and manifest.yaml files to identify what should be happening when compared to the similar files from the AzureOpenAI implementation.
