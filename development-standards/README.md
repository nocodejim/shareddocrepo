## üéØ Key Takeaways

### Most Critical Lessons (Top 5)

1. **Build Success ‚â† Working Application**
   - ALWAYS test in actual environment (browser for frontend, real API calls for backend)
   - Occurred 3+ times in a single project session
   - See: CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md ‚Üí "CRITICAL TESTING FAILURES"

2. **Commit ALL Lock Files**
   - Missing lock files = different dependencies per environment = runtime crashes
   - Affects: poetry.lock, package-lock.json, uv.lock
   - See: CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md ‚Üí "DEPENDENCY & LOCK FILE DISASTERS"

3. **Use Migration Autogenerate**
   - Manually written migrations = systematic failures (4 occurrences in one session)
   - ALWAYS use `alembic revision --autogenerate` then review
   - See: CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md ‚Üí "DATABASE MIGRATION FAILURES"

4. **Never Use System-Wide Docker Commands**
   - `docker system prune` would destroy ALL containers/volumes/networks
   - ONLY use project-scoped: `docker-compose down -v`
   - See: CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md ‚Üí "CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUES"

5. **Comprehensive Logging During MVP**
   - Insufficient logging = hours wasted debugging
   - Log every critical step with `[Component] Description` format
   - See: CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md ‚Üí "INSUFFICIENT DEBUGGING"

## üöÄ Quick Start for New Projects

### 1. Choose a Template

Based on project type, use patterns from:
- **Full-Stack Web App**: devops-maturity-model pattern
- **Python CLI Tool**: pmeaze_scraper pattern
- **MCP Server**: spira-mcp-connection pattern
- **PHP Web App**: stinkin-park-site pattern

See: DEVELOPMENT-PATTERNS.md ‚Üí "PROJECT STRUCTURE PATTERNS"

### 2. Setup Checklist

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p my-project/{backend,frontend,docs,tests}
cd my-project

# Initialize git
git init

# Create .gitignore FIRST
cat > .gitignore <<EOF
.env
.env.local
venv/
.venv/
test_env/
node_modules/
__pycache__/
*.log
*_diagnostics.*
EOF

# Create environment file template
cat > .env.example <<EOF
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
EOF

# Create CLAUDE.md from template
cp development-standards/templates/CLAUDE.md .

# Create lessons-learned.md
cp development-standards/templates/lessons-learned.md docs/

# Setup containerization
cp development-standards/templates/docker-compose.yml .
```

### 3. Pre-Commit Protocol

Before EVERY commit:
```bash
# 1. Update lessons learned if issues encountered
vim docs/lessons-learned.md

# 2. Test in actual environment
# Frontend: Open in browser with DevTools
# Backend: Test with real API calls
# Check logs for expected behavior

# 3. Run automated tests
./tests/run-all-tests.sh

# 4. Review changes
git diff --cached

# 5. Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: Add feature description

Detailed explanation of what and why.

Implementation details:
- Detail 1
- Detail 2

Test results:
- Test 1 passed
- Test 2 passed

## üîç How to Use These Documents

### When Starting a New Project
1. Read this README
2. Choose appropriate pattern from DEVELOPMENT-PATTERNS.md
3. Review critical mistakes from CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md
4. Set up .gitignore and environment files FIRST
5. Create CLAUDE.md and lessons-learned.md

### During Development
1. Reference patterns for common tasks
2. Follow testing checklist before claiming "working"
3. Document mistakes in project's lessons-learned.md
4. Use docker-compose, never system-wide Docker commands
5. Commit lock files immediately after dependency changes

### Before Commits
1. Test in actual environment (not just build success)
2. Update lessons-learned.md if issues occurred
3. Run automated tests
4. Review git diff for secrets
5. Write detailed commit message with test results

### When Debugging
1. Add comprehensive logging first
2. Check CRITICAL-MISTAKES-LEARNED.md for similar issues
3. Test in actual environment, not just containers
4. Check logs with expected behavior in mind
5. Document the issue and fix

## üí° Best Practices Summary

### Testing
- Build success is necessary but NOT sufficient
- Test in actual environment (browser/API/real usage)
- Add comprehensive logging during MVP development
- Run automated tests before every commit
- Manual browser testing required for frontend

### Safety
- Never use system-wide Docker commands
- Only project-scoped operations (docker-compose)
- Review git diff before commit for secrets
- Add virtual environments to .gitignore immediately

### Dependencies
- ALWAYS commit lock files
- Test in fresh environment after changes
- Pin versions for known incompatibilities
- Use package manager's lock file install (npm ci, poetry install)

### Database
- Use migration autogenerate (alembic, etc.)
- Review generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on clean database
- Compare models to migrations systematically

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches always
- Descriptive commit messages with test results
- Update lessons learned when issues occur
- Include implementation details in commits

### Documentation
- CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
- README.md for quick start
