## Core Features

### Code Completion

Code completion is the foundational feature of GitHub Copilot, providing real-time suggestions as you type.

**How It Works**:
- Analyzes your code context and comments
- Suggests completions for lines, blocks, or entire functions
- Updates suggestions as you type
- Learns from acceptances and rejections

**Activation**:
- Automatically triggered as you type
- Accept with Tab key
- Reject with Esc key
- Cycle through alternatives with Alt+[ and Alt+]

**Best Practices**:
- Write clear comments before expected completions
- Provide type hints and function signatures
- Keep related code visible in open tabs
- Use descriptive variable and function names

**Example Comment for Effective Completion**:
```python
# Parse CSV data from file_path
# Handle potential errors like file not found or invalid format
# Return a list of dictionaries with the CSV data
# Each dictionary represents a row with column names as keys
def parse_csv(file_path):
```

## Prompting Strategies

Effective prompting is essential for getting the most out of GitHub Copilot.

### General Prompting Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you want
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant information
3. **Set Constraints**: Specify any limitations or requirements
4. **Use Examples**: Show patterns you want to follow
5. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Split into manageable parts

### Prompting Techniques

#### Zero-Shot Prompting
Provide a clear instruction without examples:
```
Create a function to validate email addresses that checks format and domain existence.
```

#### One-Shot Prompting
Include a single example:
```
Implement a data validation function similar to this:

function validatePhone(phone) {
  const regex = /^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}$/;
  return regex.test(phone);
}

Now implement a similar function for email validation.
```

#### Few-Shot Prompting
Provide multiple examples to establish a pattern:
```
Here are some utility functions:

// Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
}

// Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
function fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9;
}

Now implement functions for converting:
1. Kilometers to miles
2. Miles to kilometers
```

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Guide Copilot through a reasoning process:
```
Let's implement a function to find the nth Fibonacci number.

First, we need to understand the Fibonacci sequence:
- It starts with 0, 1
- Each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers
- So the sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

For implementation, we should consider:
- Edge cases (n = 0, n = 1)
- Performance considerations for larger values of n
- Whether to use recursion or iteration

Now, implement the function:
```

### Domain-Specific Prompting

#### Web Development
```
Create a React component for a responsive navigation bar that:
- Collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile
- Supports dark/light theme switching
- Highlights the active route
- Includes dropdown menus for nested navigation
```

#### Data Science
```
Implement a data preprocessing function that:
- Handles missing values through imputation
- Normalizes numerical features
- Encodes categorical variables
- Removes outliers using IQR method
- Returns a processed DataFrame ready for model training
```

#### DevOps
```
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Builds a Node.js application
- Runs unit and integration tests
- Performs static code analysis
- Builds a Docker container
- Deploys to staging environment if on develop branch
- Deploys to production if on main branch
```

### Common Prompting Mistakes

1. **Being Too Vague**: "Improve this code" vs. "Optimize this function for performance by reducing unnecessary calculations"
2. **Providing Insufficient Context**: Not sharing enough about surrounding code or requirements
3. **Overcomplicating Requests**: Asking for too many things at once
4. **Ignoring Constraints**: Not specifying important limitations or requirements
5. **Unclear Priorities**: Not indicating what aspects are most important
