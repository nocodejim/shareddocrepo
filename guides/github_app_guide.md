## Introduction

GitHub Apps are the modern, secure way to integrate with GitHub's ecosystem. They provide fine-grained permissions, enhanced security, and better scalability compared to Personal Access Tokens (PATs). This guide will walk you through creating a GitHub App from scratch, explaining the "why" behind each step.

---

## Why GitHub Apps vs Personal Access Tokens

### The Limitations of Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

**Personal Access Tokens are tied to a user account** and inherit all the permissions that user has. This creates several significant limitations:

- **Over-privileged access**: PATs can access ALL repositories the user has access to
- **User dependency**: If the token owner leaves the organization, all integrations break
- **Limited scalability**: Maximum of 50 fine-grained PATs per user
- **Broad permissions**: Classic PATs use coarse-grained scopes (like `repo` for all repository access)
- **Security risks**: If leaked, a PAT can grant full access based on the user's permissions
- **No organizational control**: Organization owners cannot control or audit PAT usage

### Why GitHub Apps Are Superior

**GitHub Apps act as independent entities** with their own identity and controlled permissions:

#### 1. **Fine-Grained Permissions**
- Request only the specific permissions your app needs
- Permissions are granular (e.g., "read repository contents" vs "full repo access")
- Reduces attack surface if credentials are compromised

#### 2. **Repository-Specific Access**
- Control exactly which repositories the app can access
- Users/organizations decide during installation which repos to grant access to
- Not tied to a user's broader repository access

#### 3. **Enhanced Security**
- **Short-lived tokens**: Installation tokens expire automatically
- **Independent of users**: App continues working even if the installing user leaves
- **Webhook validation**: Built-in webhook secret validation
- **Audit trail**: Clear attribution of app actions

#### 4. **Organizational Control**
- Organization owners can approve/deny app installations
- Centralized management of app permissions
- Can require approval for fine-grained PATs accessing organization resources

#### 5. **Better Rate Limits**
- GitHub Apps get higher, elastic rate limits that scale with repository count
- Not limited by individual user rate limits

#### 6. **Built-in Webhooks**
- Centralized webhook management across all accessible repositories
- No need to configure webhooks individually per repository

## Key Benefits of GitHub Apps

### For Organizations
- **Security compliance**: Meet enterprise security requirements
- **Access control**: Granular control over what integrations can access
- **Continuity**: Integrations survive employee turnover
- **Auditability**: Clear logs of app actions and permissions

### For Developers
- **Scalability**: Build integrations that work across multiple organizations
- **Reliability**: More robust authentication and error handling
- **Flexibility**: Can act as the app or on behalf of users as needed
- **Modern API access**: Access to newest GitHub features and APIs

### For Users
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of what permissions are granted
- **Control**: Can approve/deny app access to specific repositories
- **Safety**: Reduced risk from over-privileged integrations

## Prerequisites

Before creating a GitHub App, ensure you have:

- **GitHub account** with appropriate permissions
- **Development environment** (if building a webhook-receiving app)
- **Hosting solution** (for webhook endpoint, if needed)
- **Basic understanding** of OAuth 2.0 and webhook concepts

### Technical Requirements (if building a full app)
- **Node.js 12+** (for most modern frameworks)
- **Web server** capability (Express.js, FastAPI, etc.)
- **SSL certificate** (required for production webhook endpoints)

---

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Navigate to GitHub App Settings

1. **Go to GitHub** and click your profile picture in the top-right corner
2. **Select Settings** from the dropdown menu
3. **In the left sidebar**, click **"Developer settings"**
4. **Click "GitHub Apps"** in the left sidebar
5. **Click "New GitHub App"** button

**For Organization-owned Apps:**
1. Click **"Your organizations"** instead of Settings
2. **Select the organization** you want to own the app
3. **Click "Settings"** next to the organization name
4. **Follow the same Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App path**

### Step 2: Basic App Information

#### App Name
- **Enter a unique name** (max 34 characters)
- **Choose something descriptive** (e.g., "MyCompany-CI-Bot")
- **Must be unique** across all of GitHub
- **Will be displayed** when your app takes actions (converted to lowercase with special characters replaced)

#### Description
- **Provide a clear description** of what your app does
- **Users will see this** when installing your app
- **Include the value proposition** and main functionality

#### Homepage URL
- **Enter your app's website URL**
- **Can be your repository URL** if no dedicated website exists
- **Or use your organization/personal website**
- **Must be a complete URL** (including https://)

### Step 3: User Authorization Settings (Optional)

#### Callback URL
- **Only needed if** your app will authenticate users (generate user access tokens)
- **Enter the URL** where users should be redirected after authorization
- **Can add up to 10 URLs** for different environments
- **Example**: `https://myapp.com/auth/github/callback`

#### User Authorization Options
- **"Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation"**
  - ✅ **Check this** if your app needs to act on behalf of users
  - ❌ **Leave unchecked** if your app only needs repository access
- **"Expire user authorization tokens"**
  - ✅ **Keep checked** for better security (GitHub strongly recommends)
- **"Enable Device Flow"**
  - ✅ **Check if** building a CLI or device-based app

### Step 4: Post-Installation Setup

#### Setup URL (Optional)
- **Enter a URL** to redirect users after installation
- **Use this to** provide additional setup instructions
- **Example**: `https://myapp.com/setup`

#### Redirect on Update
- ✅ **Check this** if you want users redirected to setup URL when they modify installations

### Step 5: Webhook Configuration

#### Active Webhooks
- ✅ **Keep "Active" checked** unless your app doesn't need real-time events
- ❌ **Uncheck only if** building an authentication-only app

#### Webhook URL
- **Enter the public URL** where GitHub should send webhook events
- **Must be accessible** from the internet
- **Example**: `https://myapp.com/webhook`
- **For development**: Use tools like [smee.io](https://smee.io) or ngrok

#### Webhook Secret
- **Generate a random string** (recommended 20+ characters)
- **Use this to validate** webhook payloads are from GitHub
- **Store securely** - you'll need this in your application code
- **Example**: `your-super-secret-webhook-key-123`

#### SSL Verification
- ✅ **Enable SSL verification** (GitHub strongly recommends)
- **Only disable** for local development with self-signed certificates

### Step 6: Permissions Configuration

**This is the most critical step.** Choose the minimum permissions your app needs:

#### Repository Permissions
Choose from **"No access"**, **"Read"**, or **"Read & write"** for each:

- **Actions**: Access to GitHub Actions workflows and runs
- **Administration**: Repository settings and admin functions  
- **Checks**: Check runs and check suites (CI/CD status)
- **Contents**: Repository files and content
- **Deployments**: Deployment statuses and environments
- **Issues**: Issues, labels, and milestones
- **Metadata**: Basic repository information (always required for most apps)
- **Pull requests**: PR management and reviews
- **Statuses**: Commit status checks
- **Webhooks**: Repository webhook management

#### Organization Permissions
- **Administration**: Organization settings
- **Members**: Organization membership information
- **Plan**: Organization subscription information

#### Account Permissions
User-level permissions (only if app acts on behalf of users):
- **Email addresses**: User email access
- **Followers**: User follow relationships
- **Git SSH keys**: User SSH key management
- **GPG keys**: User GPG key management

### Step 7: Event Subscriptions

**Select webhook events** your app should receive. Events depend on permissions:

#### Common Events
- **Issues**: Issue opened, closed, labeled, etc.
- **Pull request**: PR opened, merged, review requested, etc.
- **Push**: Code pushed to repository
- **Release**: New releases published
- **Status**: Commit status updates
- **Check run**: CI/CD check completion
- **Installation**: App installed/uninstalled

### Step 8: Installation Settings

#### Where can this GitHub App be installed?
- **"Only on this account"**: Limits to your personal account or organization
- **"Any account"**: Allows installation on any GitHub account (for public apps)

### Step 9: Create the App

1. **Review all settings** carefully
2. **Click "Create GitHub App"**
3. **Save the App ID** (you'll need this for authentication)

---

## Configuration Details

### After Creation: Essential Setup

#### 1. Generate Private Key
1. **On your new app's settings page**, scroll to "Private keys"
2. **Click "Generate a private key"**
3. **Download the `.pem` file** immediately
4. **Store securely** - this is used for app authentication

#### 2. Note Important Values
- **App ID**: Found at the top of your app settings
- **Client ID**: For user authorization flows
- **Client Secret**: Generate if needed for user auth

#### 3. Environment Variables Setup
Create a `.env` file with:
```bash
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./path/to/private-key.pem
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.abc123def456
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

## Authentication & Security

### Three Types of Authentication

#### 1. App Authentication
- **Used to**: Generate installation tokens, manage app settings
- **Token type**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Lifetime**: 10 minutes
- **Use the private key** to sign JWT tokens

#### 2. Installation Authentication  
- **Used to**: Access repositories where app is installed
- **Token type**: Installation access token
- **Lifetime**: 1 hour (auto-refresh recommended)
- **Most common** for repository operations

#### 3. User Authentication (Optional)
- **Used to**: Act on behalf of a user
- **Token type**: User access token
- **Lifetime**: 8 hours (with refresh token)
- **Only if** user authorization is enabled

### Security Best Practices

#### Private Key Security
- **Store in secure location** (key vault, encrypted storage)
- **Never commit to version control**
- **Use environment variables** or secure secret management
- **Rotate regularly** (generate new keys periodically)

#### Webhook Security
- **Always validate webhook signatures** using your webhook secret
- **Use HTTPS endpoints** only
- **Validate payload structure** before processing
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

#### Token Management
- **Cache installation tokens** (but respect 1-hour expiry)
- **Implement refresh logic** for user tokens
- **Use minimum required permissions** for each operation
- **Log token usage** for audit purposes

## Installation & Testing

### Installing Your App

#### 1. Install on Your Account
1. **Go to your app's settings page**
2. **Click "Install App"** in the left sidebar
3. **Choose repositories** to grant access to
4. **Complete installation**

#### 2. Verify Installation
1. **Check "Installed GitHub Apps"** in your account settings
2. **Verify permissions** are as expected
3. **Test webhook delivery** (if configured)

### Testing Your App

#### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install smee for webhook forwarding
npm install -g smee-client

# Start smee proxy (use your smee.io URL)
smee --url https://smee.io/your-channel --target http://localhost:3000/webhook
```

#### Basic Webhook Handler (Node.js Example)
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Webhook handler
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-hub-signature-256'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  const digest = 'sha256=' + hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');
  
  if (signature !== digest) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  
  console.log('Webhook received:', req.body);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server listening on port 3000');
});
```
