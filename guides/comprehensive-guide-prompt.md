# Comprehensive Technical Guide Creation Prompt

## Template for comprehensive technical guides

I need a comprehensive guide on [INSERT SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY/TOOL HERE] that meets the following requirements:

## Required Components

### 1. Technical Depth and Completeness
- Provide complete coverage of all administrative settings and configuration options
- Include step-by-step instructions with exact menu paths and setting names
- Detail what happens during each key process or workflow
- Explain the "why" behind configuration choices, not just how to set them
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites

### 2. User Experience Walkthroughs
- Explain exactly what users see and experience at each step
- Include visual descriptions of UI changes and interactive elements
- Detail the complete end-to-end workflow for key processes
- Highlight user decision points and their implications
- Provide troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### 3. Technical Context and Related Technologies
- Define all technical terms and protocols (e.g., "What is MCP in this context?")
- Explain how this technology integrates with other systems
- Clarify which components are built-in vs. requiring separate implementation
- Include version-specific information with clear labeling of feature availability
- Detail performance implications of different configuration choices

### 4. Context Management
- Explain exactly how to include/exclude specific content or context
- Detail file patterns, configuration files, and context control mechanisms
- Provide examples of configuration for different scenarios
- Explain limitations and best practices for context management

### 5. Enterprise-Specific Considerations
- Address enterprise security concerns and compliance features
- Detail multi-user management and role-based access control
- Include licensing, quota management, and cost control mechanisms
- Explain differences between individual and enterprise features
- Provide guidance on organizational governance and policies

### 6. Practical Application Guidance
- Include clear use cases with specific examples
- Provide decision matrices for when to use different features/options
- Include performance optimization guidance
- Detail scaling considerations for larger implementations
- Offer migration or upgrade strategies if relevant

## Format Requirements
- Use clear headings and subheadings for easy navigation
- Include tables for feature comparisons where appropriate
- Provide code blocks or configuration examples as needed
- Use numbered lists for sequential procedures
- Include "Note" and "Warning" callouts for important considerations

Please ensure the guide is thorough, technically accurate, and follows a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts. The goal is to create a resource that would allow a technical professional to fully implement and optimize the technology without requiring additional research.
