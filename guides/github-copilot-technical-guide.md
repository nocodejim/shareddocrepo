## Prompting Strategies

Effective prompting is key to getting the most out of GitHub Copilot. These strategies work across all Copilot interfaces.

### Basic Prompting Principles

1. **Be Specific and Clear**
   - Define requirements explicitly
   - Specify expected input/output behavior
   - State any constraints or performance considerations

2. **Provide Context**
   - Reference related code or concepts
   - Explain the problem domain
   - Mention relevant technologies or dependencies

3. **Use Examples**
   - Provide sample inputs and expected outputs
   - Reference existing code patterns
   - Include edge cases

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### Zero-Shot Prompting
Provide a clear instruction without examples:
```
// Implement a function to validate email addresses
// that checks for proper format and DNS
```

#### One-Shot Prompting
Include a single example:
```
// Implement a function to validate URLs similar to this:
// function isValidEmail(email) {
//   const pattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
//   return pattern.test(email);
// }
```

#### Few-Shot Prompting
Provide multiple examples to establish a pattern:
```
// Implement validators for the following formats:
// 1. US Phone Numbers
//    Example: formatPhoneNumber('1234567890') -> '(123) 456-7890'
// 2. Credit Card Numbers
//    Example: formatCreditCard('1234567890123456') -> '1234-5678-9012-3456'
```

#### Persona-Based Prompting
Ask Copilot to assume a specific perspective:
```
// As a senior security engineer, implement a secure password hashing function
```

### Domain-Specific Prompting

#### Web Development Prompts
```
// Create a React component for a responsive navigation bar
// that collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile
// and supports dark/light theme switching
```

#### Data Analysis Prompts
```
// Implement a function to analyze the dataset from 'users.csv'
// and return demographics statistics grouped by age brackets
```

#### DevOps Prompts
```
// Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and tests a Node.js app,
// then deploys to AWS if tests pass
```

### Function Generation Patterns

1. **Comment-First Development**
   Start with detailed comments before generating code:
   ```
   // Function: processPayment
   // Description: Processes a payment through a payment gateway
   // Parameters:
   //   - amount: number (in cents)
   //   - paymentMethod: 'credit' | 'debit' | 'paypal'
   //   - customerId: string
   // Returns:
   //   - Promise<PaymentResult>
   // Throws:
   //   - PaymentDeclinedError: If payment is declined
   //   - ValidationError: If parameters are invalid
   ```

2. **Test-Driven Approach**
   Start with test cases to guide implementation:
   ```
   // Implement a sorting algorithm that satisfies these tests:
   // test('empty array returns empty array', () => {
   //   expect(sort([])).toEqual([]);
   // });
   // test('sorted array remains unchanged', () => {
   //   expect(sort([1, 2, 3])).toEqual([1, 2, 3]);
   // });
   // test('unsorted array becomes sorted', () => {
   //   expect(sort([3, 1, 2])).toEqual([1, 2, 3]);
   // });
   ```

3. **Implementation Steps Comments**
   Break down the implementation into steps:
   ```
   // Implement a binary search tree with these steps:
   // 1. Create a Node class with value, left, and right properties
   // 2. Create a BinarySearchTree class
   // 3. Implement insert method
   // 4. Implement search method
   // 5. Implement delete method
   // 6. Implement inOrder, preOrder, and postOrder traversal
   ```

## Context Management

Effective context management ensures GitHub Copilot understands your codebase and requirements.

### Workspace Awareness

#### VS Code Workspace Management
