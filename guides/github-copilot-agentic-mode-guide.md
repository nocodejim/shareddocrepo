# Comprehensive Guide to GitHub Copilot Agentic Mode

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot's Agentic Mode represents a significant evolution in AI-assisted coding, transforming Copilot from a code suggestion tool to a fully autonomous development partner. Released in February 2025, this feature enables Copilot to take a more proactive role in the development process by iterating on its own code, recognizing and fixing errors automatically, suggesting terminal commands, and analyzing run-time errors with self-healing capabilities.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Copilot Agentic Mode, including its capabilities, use cases, available models, terminal compatibility, and best practices for effective implementation.

## What is GitHub Copilot Agentic Mode?

Agentic Mode is an evolution of GitHub Copilot that acts as an autonomous peer programmer, capable of performing multi-step coding tasks based on natural language prompts. Unlike standard Copilot or even Copilot Edits, Agentic Mode can:

- Iterate on its own output and the results of that output
- Complete all necessary subtasks to fulfill a request
- Infer additional tasks that weren't explicitly specified
- Autonomously determine relevant context and files to edit
- Suggest and execute terminal commands (with user approval)
- Self-heal by monitoring the correctness of code edits and terminal outputs

As described by GitHub, Agentic Mode "takes Copilot beyond answering a question, instead completing all necessary subtasks across automatically identified or generated files to ensure your primary goal is achieved."

## System Requirements & Availability

Agentic Mode is now available to all VS Code users as of April 2025. Here's what you need to use it:

- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Copilot subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
- Optional: VS Code Insiders for early access to new features

## Getting Started with Copilot Agentic Mode

### Setup

1. Install and set up Visual Studio Code
2. Install the GitHub Copilot extension
3. In VS Code, open the Settings editor (⌘, on Mac or Ctrl+, on Windows/Linux)
4. Enable the `chat.agent.enabled` setting
5. Open the Copilot Chat view using the Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar or with the keyboard shortcut ⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)
6. Select "Agent" from the chat mode dropdown in the Chat view

### Using Agentic Mode

Once set up, you can start an agentic session by:

1. Opening the Chat view
2. Selecting "Agent" from the chat mode dropdown
3. Entering a high-level task description as your prompt
4. Pressing Enter to submit your request

Copilot will then:
- Determine relevant context and files
- Make edits across multiple files as needed
- Suggest terminal commands for you to approve and execute
- Monitor results and iterate to fix any issues

## Terminal Compatibility

Copilot Agentic Mode works with various terminal environments:

- **Windows Terminal**: Full support including PowerShell, Command Prompt, and WSL
- **PowerShell**: Full support for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core
- **Git Bash**: Well-supported for git operations
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Full support for Linux commands within Windows
- **Virtual Environments**: Compatible with Python venvs and other virtual environments

For Windows Terminal users, there's also Terminal Chat which allows using GitHub Copilot to get command suggestions and explanations directly in the terminal.

## Available AI Models

Copilot Agentic Mode supports various AI models, each with different strengths:

- **GPT-4o**: Default model, balances speed and capability, supports images
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Excellent for code logic and complex reasoning
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Most advanced reasoning, best for complex tasks
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Fast response times, good for straightforward tasks
- **GPT-4.5**: Superior for multi-step reasoning and complex problems

Model selection depends on your task requirements:
- For quick iterations or straightforward tasks: Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o
- For multi-file operations or deep reasoning: Claude 3.7 Sonnet or GPT-4.5
- For image-based coding tasks: GPT-4o or Gemini 2.0 Flash

The VS Code team has noted that in their testing, "Claude Sonnet" performs better than GPT-4o for Agentic Mode use cases, with significant improvements seen with Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

## File Creation Capabilities

Agentic Mode can create and modify multiple files simultaneously based on your prompt:

- **App Creation**: Can build full applications from scratch (web apps, desktop tools, etc.)
- **Refactoring**: Can perform refactorings across multiple files
- **Testing**: Can write and run tests for your code
- **Migration**: Can help migrate legacy code to modern frameworks
- **Documentation**: Can generate documentation for your codebase

While there's no explicit limit on the number of files it can create or modify at once, performance is best in smaller repositories. The VS Code team notes that they've "seen Copilot agent mode excel in smaller repos" while acknowledging that "refactorings across multiple files in large codebases - like vscode - is a tough challenge for any software engineering agent today."

## When to Use Agentic Mode vs. Copilot Edits

GitHub provides guidance on when to use each tool:

**Use Copilot Edits for**:
- Fast, precise tweaks
- Refactoring a single function
- Squashing a bug
- Applying consistent changes across well-defined files

**Use Agentic Mode for**:
- Multi-step coding tasks spanning multiple files
- Building complete features or applications
- Complex refactorings requiring understanding of patterns across the codebase
- Tasks requiring terminal commands or tool calls
- Tasks that benefit from auto-correction of errors

As a general rule: if your task is well-defined and scoped, stick to Edits mode. When you need more autonomous help with open-ended tasks, use Agentic Mode.

## Impressive Demo Scenarios

These scenarios showcase Agentic Mode's capabilities and make for effective demonstrations:

1. **Full Web App Creation**: Ask Agentic Mode to build a web application from scratch, such as "Create a marathon training tracker web app with React and Node.js"

2. **Feature Implementation Across Multiple Files**: Request a feature that requires changes to multiple parts of your codebase, such as "Add authentication to my Express app"

3. **Interactive Terminal Features**: Ask for terminal-based features like "Implement typing animation, keyboard navigation, and theme switching in my terminal app"

4. **Converting Designs to Code**: Use Vision for Copilot to upload a UI mockup and have it generate the corresponding UI code

5. **Framework Migration**: Have Agentic Mode help migrate a legacy app to a modern framework, such as "Convert this jQuery app to React"

## Best Practices for Effective Use

1. **Clearly Define Your Goals**: Be specific about your requirements while allowing room for Copilot to infer necessary subtasks

2. **Review and Iterate**: Always review suggested changes before accepting them; use the iteration capabilities for refinement

3. **Use the Right Model**: Match the AI model to your task's complexity and requirements

4. **Guide with Context**: For more precise control, explicitly reference context with #file, or create a specifications.md file

5. **Monitor Performance**: Be aware that Agentic Mode uses more resources than standard Copilot

6. **Understand Limitations**: Agentic Mode works best with smaller codebases and may struggle with very large or complex projects

7. **Use Terminal Commands Wisely**: Always review terminal commands before executing them

8. **Leverage MCP Tools**: Take advantage of Model Context Protocol tools for enhanced capabilities
