# Advanced GitHub Copilot Agent Repository Discovery Guide

## Introduction

This advanced guide focuses specifically on leveraging GitHub Copilot Agent's most powerful capabilities to understand complex Java repositories. Agent mode significantly surpasses Chat and Edit modes by providing autonomous workspace exploration, multi-file analysis, and the ability to generate comprehensive visualizations without manual intervention.

## GitHub Copilot Agent: Latest Capabilities (April 2025)

GitHub Copilot Agent has evolved significantly, with several capabilities that make it exceptionally powerful for repository discovery:

| Capability | Description | How to Leverage |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Autonomous Workspace Exploration | Agent can search and analyze files across the entire workspace | Prompt Agent to explore specific patterns or file types |
| Multi-step Reasoning | Agent can break down complex tasks and reason through solutions | Structure prompts with clear objectives and evaluation criteria |
| File Generation | Agent can create new documentation and visualization files | Request structured output formats like PlantUML or Mermaid |
| Terminal Command Execution | Agent can run analysis commands (with permission) | Allow Agent to run non-destructive analysis commands |
| Self-correction | Agent can evaluate its own output quality and refine results | Include quality checks in your prompts |
| Context Gathering | Agent can automatically gather relevant context | Guide which contexts are most important to consider |

## Context Management: The Key to Success

### What Context to Provide

When working with an unfamiliar repository, strategically providing context dramatically improves Agent's performance:

#### Essential Context to Add Manually

1. **Build Files**
   - Open `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` files to provide dependency information
   - This helps Agent understand the project's technology stack and dependencies

2. **Configuration Files**
   - Open `application.properties`, `application.yml`, or similar files
   - These reveal environment configurations, database connections, and external services

3. **Entry Point Classes**
   - Open files with `main()` methods or application bootstrap classes
   - Look for classes named `Application.java` or containing `@SpringBootApplication`

4. **Package Structure**
   - Open a few representative files from different packages
   - Include at least one controller, service, and repository if identifiable

5. **Metadata Files**
   - Open `.gitignore`, `README.md` (even if incomplete), and any CI/CD configuration

#### How to Add Context Systematically

1. **During Agent Initialization**
   - Open 3-5 key files before launching Agent for the first time
   - Prioritize configuration and entry point files

2. **Progressive Context Addition**
   - After initial analysis, open files Agent identifies as critical
   - Keep the most important 5-7 files open simultaneously

3. **Context Switching**
   - When exploring specific subsystems, close irrelevant files
   - Open related files from the same module or package

## Agent Mode Best Practices and Expert Techniques

### Context Management Strategies for Optimal Results

1. **Progressive Context Exposure**
   - Begin with configuration and entry point files
   - Gradually introduce domain model and service files
   - End with implementation details and utilities
   - This builds Agent's understanding from high-level to details

2. **Contextual Batching**
   - Group related files by domain or component
   - Expose Agent to one contextual area at a time
   - For example, open all authentication-related files together

3. **Strategic File Selection**
   - Use the "80/20 rule" - identify the 20% of files that contain 80% of the critical information
   - Prioritize files with high connectivity to other components
   - Look for files with many imports or that are imported frequently

4. **File Type Prioritization Matrix**

   | Priority | File Types | Rationale |
   |----------|------------|-----------|
   | 1 | Configuration, Application Entry | Provides system boundaries and dependencies |
   | 2 | Interface Definitions, API Contracts | Defines component relationships |
   | 3 | Service Implementations | Contains core business logic |
   | 4 | Entity/Model Definitions | Reveals domain concepts |
   | 5 | Repository/DAO Implementations | Shows persistence approach |
   | 6 | Controllers/Endpoints | Exposes application capabilities |
   | 7 | Utilities/Helpers | Reveals cross-cutting concerns |

### Quality Control Framework for Agent Responses

Ensure Agent provides high-quality responses by explicitly requesting:

1. **Validation Steps**
   ```
   After completing your analysis, validate your findings by:
   1. Cross-checking component relationships for consistency
   2. Verifying that all identified interfaces have implementations
   3. Confirming that the data flow is complete without gaps
   4. Testing that your generated visualizations accurately reflect the codebase
   ```

2. **Confidence Indicators**
   ```
   For each major finding, indicate your confidence level (High/Medium/Low) and explain what evidence supports your conclusion or what information would help increase confidence.
   ```

3. **Alternative Interpretations**
   ```
   Where patterns are ambiguous, present the alternative interpretations and explain your reasoning for selecting one over others.
   ```

4. **Methodology Transparency**
   ```
   Explain your analytical process, including which files you examined, patterns you identified, and how you connected the components in your analysis.
   ```

### Maximizing Agent's Autonomous Capabilities

1. **Allow Broad Workspace Access**
   - Give Agent permission to scan the entire workspace
   - Enable it to run non-destructive commands (like `find`, `grep`, etc.)
   - Let it examine git history when available

2. **Implement Multi-Round Exploration**
   ```
   First, explore the high-level structure and identify key components.
   Then, drill down into the most critical components you've identified.
   Finally, analyze the relationships between these components in detail.
   ```

3. **Expert Prompting Techniques**

   - **Specify Tangible Outputs**: "Generate a PlantUML diagram showing..."
   - **Set Quality Criteria**: "Ensure all identified services have their dependencies mapped"
   - **Request Self-Validation**: "After creating the diagram, verify all components are represented"
   - **Use Domain-Specific Language**: Incorporate Java-specific terminology like "dependency injection," "annotations," etc.

4. **Terminal Command Guidance**

   If you grant Agent terminal access, suggest these useful commands:
   
   ```
   You may use these terminal commands to analyze the codebase:
   - find . -name "*.java" | grep -E "Service|Repository|Controller" to locate key components
   - grep -r "extends|implements" --include="*.java" . to find inheritance relationships
   - find . -name "*.java" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -nr | head -n 10 to identify the largest files
   ```
