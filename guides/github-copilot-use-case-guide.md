## Introduction

GitHub Copilot has evolved from a simple code completion tool into a comprehensive AI pair programming solution with multiple operational modes and capabilities. This guide focuses on practical, real-world applications of GitHub Copilot across different development scenarios, with strategies for maximizing effectiveness and addressing common challenges.

Each section includes specific prompting techniques, examples, and guidance on which Copilot mode (Chat, Edit, or Agent) is most effective for the particular use case. The guide is designed for both individual developers and enterprise teams, with special attention to differences between free and paid subscription tiers.

## Test Generation and Coverage

Testing is one of the most powerful applications of GitHub Copilot, enabling developers to rapidly increase code coverage and improve software quality.

### Systematic Approach to Test Coverage Improvement

#### Phase 1: Establishing Basic Coverage (20%)

For initial test coverage, focus on core functionality with basic test cases:

**Recommended Mode:** Edit Mode for beginners, Agent Mode for experienced users

**Prompt Template:**
```
Create unit tests for the [ClassName] class focusing on the main public methods.
Include tests for standard inputs and obvious edge cases.
Use [TestFramework] and follow these patterns:
1. Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome
3. Setup common test fixtures with appropriate lifecycle methods
```

**Example for Java with JUnit:**
```
Create unit tests for the PaymentProcessor class focusing on the main public methods.
Include tests for standard inputs and obvious edge cases.
Use JUnit 5 and follow these patterns:
1. Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome
3. Setup common test fixtures with @BeforeEach and @AfterEach
```

#### Phase 2: Expanding Coverage (50%)

Build on the foundation with more complex test scenarios:

**Recommended Mode:** Agent Mode

**Prompt Template:**
```
Expand test coverage for [ClassName] to include:
1. Conditional logic branches
2. Error handling paths
3. Boundary conditions
4. Integration with dependencies

Prioritize methods with complex logic and multiple execution paths.
Use mocking for external dependencies and focus on validating both behavior and state.
```

**Example for React Component Testing:**
```
Expand test coverage for UserProfile component to include:
1. Conditional rendering based on user roles
2. Error states when API calls fail
3. Loading states during data fetching
4. Integration with authentication context

Prioritize interactive elements and form submission logic.
Use React Testing Library with Jest and mock the API client.
```

#### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (80%)

Target complex scenarios and edge cases:

**Recommended Mode:** Agent Mode

**Prompt Template:**
```
Create comprehensive tests to achieve 80% coverage for [CodeBase/Component].
Focus on:
1. Complex conditional paths
2. Race conditions and asynchronous behavior
3. Integration between components
4. Performance characteristics
5. Security constraints

Use advanced testing techniques including:
1. Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
2. Property-based testing for input validation
3. Mock customization for complex behaviors
4. Snapshot testing for UI components
```

   ```

2. **Performance Test Generation**
   ```
   Create performance tests for the API endpoint /api/products that:
   1. Measures response time under various loads
   2. Tests with 10, 100, and 1000 concurrent users
   3. Verifies behavior with cached vs. uncached data
   4. Identifies potential bottlenecks

   Use JMeter for load testing and include setup instructions.
   ```

3. **Security Test Implementation**
   ```
   Implement security tests for the authentication system that check for:
   1. SQL injection vulnerabilities in login fields
   2. Password strength enforcement
   3. Account lockout after failed attempts
   4. Session timeout functionality
